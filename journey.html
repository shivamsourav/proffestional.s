    <h3><em><strong>JOURNEY</strong></em></h3>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <p>A man never thought that his life is the great journey with happiness, lifelong memories, problems, guilt and lessons. The best way to enjoy your journey is that, never made any mistake again, remember every lesson and never thought that his life is worth i e, be positive. Sometimes may your journey takes a long distance with difficulties, losses and lifelong guilt. But believe in nature that one day your journey takes sharp turn to bring smile and happiness. Getting interact with new people, being good time partner is a part of journey , never think that this is the whole journey.<br> Because at the end , when your journey ends,you just the memories of  some particular days, as in your birthday and your last day.<br> According to my point of view, instead of providing your presence, power by making pillar, garden or holiday spot. Create something which provides tears with smile faces. As non government school, anathasharam, and old age home, and hospital.</p>
