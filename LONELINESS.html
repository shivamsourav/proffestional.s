    <h3>LONELINESS</h3>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <p>Physically when we came in this planet Or this stage of infinite actors with infinite audience.<br> There were lots of warm hand to hold ourselves. But internally we r unaware of every single time unit. At that age, obviously we ignore bt as our muscles of brain grow. We started feeling new emotions.
One of the unique emotion is when we are surrounded by hundred of moving creatures but we feel like we r present in a place where no one support us and feels like that our presence are meaning less.<br> That is feeling of loneliness.
At that scenario we r getting depressed but more profitably we learn a lot. Like we analyse easily everyone one in fisrt shot.<br> We observe the behavior of others at that time nd calculate their graph of respective character. Our heart strt managing everything by physical action like, tears in eyes for no reason, seeking for someone of unknown identity. And our Brain combines every data and control everything. Which makes us strong and more independent.
Loneliness and depression are interconnected. When we r feeling lonely which simply mean that we r depressed. At that point of time, we just have to forget about the current problems and the coming future issues. Just stay alone for a time and do what your heart asking to you. Whether to talk with someone or listening music or some other activities.
Loneliness is not the depression time. It is a chance for self improvement .
"You are alone and you will alone again.... Bt if you strt understanding the dept of this feeling then after every phase you will find some new minute positive features in you. </p>
