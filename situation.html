    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <p>Whenever there is a conflict btw your thoughts and nature's law, we call it a situation. Some are best which we wnt to remember whole life, some are good which makes us smile and some are worst which we keeps on regret whole life. One common things in all the three parts is that, situations are never try to break you.<br> It will always make you either by teaching some lesson or by providing some materialistic support in the form of someone or something. We just have to follow and accept the situation and believe in it that lastly we get some best thing which help us to play for further life game. It is easy to accept good and best situations, but during worst we lost our belief and hope on anything and the best lesson is only we get from worst . It make ourself mentally strong and provides us best partner.<br> We just have to be conscious about our activities, observe every thing silently and avoid discussing about it.</p>
