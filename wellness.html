    <p>One can never transform any living matter into their desired thing. As one can never provide permanent relief to anyone.<br> It can only be modified with any natural support or mental positivity. Bt natural support is as uncertain as coming earthquake so if one try to find the exact solution that they can change anyone falling conditions.one can never know their life span so if someone try to bring some short happiness time in their perpetual conditions. It is far better than to provide imaginary advice for coming time for betterment of present situation. </p>
