    <h2><em><strong>LEAF</strong></em></h2>
    <p>It is the elementary part of a tree. Without it we can consider a tree weather dead or alive.it will grow further without leaves but affection toward that tree can never  be same.Just similar a person without feelings and emotions. These tree never provide relief to any species. Almost every metabolism activities occur in leaves and it just a vital part of tree but for commercial and greedy world it is worthless.Similarly As a person with heart and feelings. If a tree having a last single leaf, get combine with light of hope of sunlight and shower of waters with rain then it will cover the entire tree with leaves. As a lonely person gets one who support and admire their feelings to bring him back to a happy life. Birds and others a fond to live in a tree which is cover with beautiful leaves which provides them a safe shelter and consistent feeding materials. As some have attractive thought bring others . So we just consider ourselves as a tree and leaf as our own feelings ,thoughts and emotions. We just have to nourish it properly and provide others to stay i.e being kind and supportive. </p>
