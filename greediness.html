    <h2><em>GREEDINESS</em></h2>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <p>Charles Darwin proposed theory of survival that those species which struggle and adapt the situation will stay long in this planet. Bt the flow of Greedyness and self centering mentality washes the dept of theory and formulate into new one that those living thing which is not in one control , live in its own way, and not the cause of any source of money will must pay off for their life. We forgot that we r just as similar species as other living thing are. Humans are just dominate the ecosystem by the power of their consciousness and thinking ability which does not mean that we eliminate other for our comfort. Nature and this planet have a covalent bond with everyone , if any single bond will break.<br> Then nature balance their other bond by its own way which may or may not favourable to humans. Sometimes it may become fatal for humans.
Now a days some campaign started which cares of other living things but the ratio is too small. We must be aware that this planet is not just for humans, we have to pay rent in the form of kindness and warm behavior to other living thing, to survive in this planet.</p>
